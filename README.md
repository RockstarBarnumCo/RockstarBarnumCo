> “History belongs to the bold. The future, to those who dare to code it.”

Welcome to the official GitHub headquarters of **Rockstar Barnum & Co.** — a command center for AI-powered innovation, preservation logistics, and smart city development.

From Bridgeport, CT to Beirut and Gaza, I'm designing tools to protect the past while building the infrastructure for a decentralized, open-source future.
